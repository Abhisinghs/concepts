# Learning Process
In this article, you will learn how to learn anything well. Because if you understand any topic you can 
explain it to someone else. We will use the famous Feynman technique to learn anything faster and effectively. 

## Question-1
### What is Feynman's technique?
Feynman's is a famous technique that, is defined as how can a person learn anything faster with deep understanding. 
They say if you can teach the topic to someone that means you understand the topic well.

## Question-2
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* I like the whole story or idea of this video but the most interesting story I got is about Thomas Edison 
using the diffuse mode to do his work.
* I can assume how they use the diffuse mode technique. when I researched and studied about it I got.
* Thomas Edison liked to take breaks from his work to relax. He would garden, go for walks, or even take naps.
* During these times, he often got new ideas. This relaxed thinking helped him come up with creative solutions to his inventions.
* When he went back to his experiments, he would use these ideas to make his inventions even better.
* Edison knew that taking breaks and letting his mind wander was just as important as working hard in his lab.

## Question-3
### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Active and diffuse mode of thinking refers to two different mental states of thinking where both have different ways to use them.

**The active mode of thinking:**
* In active mode we give full focus and effort toward the specific task or problem.
* When you are in active mode you are fully engaged with the problem or task.
* This type of thinking helps in deep analysis and decision-making processes.

**The diffuse mode of thinking:**
  * In this mode you are more relaxed and unfocused about the specific task to problems.
  * when you are in diffuse mode you are not involved in any thought process about the problem directly but indirect way you can freely think about the problem.
  * This technique helps to understand complex logical problems see the big picture and analyze it.
## Question-4
### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
* According to Josh Kaufman, you don't need 10,000 hours to acquire any new skills you only need 20 hours to acquire new skills.
* But that doesn't mean you put 20 hours into learning the skills without any strategy there is a defined strategy to acquire a new skill in 20 hours.
* 
**Deconstruct the skills**
* Break down the skill into its fundamental components and identify the most important parts to practice first.
* Focus on learning the key elements that will provide the most significant improvement in your skill acquisition.
* 
**Learn Enough to self-correct**
* Acquire enough knowledge about the skill to be able to recognize and correct your own mistakes.
* This involves understanding the basics and principles underlying the skill, which allows for effective self-assessment and improvement.
* 
**Remove practice barriers**
* Identify and eliminate any obstacles or distractions that might hinder your practice sessions.
* Create a conducive environment for learning, whether it involves setting aside dedicated time, removing distractions, or organizing materials.
* 
**Practice at least 20 hours**
* Commit to practicing the skill consistently for at least 20 hours.
* The emphasis is on focused and deliberate practice, where you actively engage in improving specific aspects of the skill.
* By dedicating this focused time, you allow yourself to make substantial progress and develop competence in the skill.
* 
## Question-5
## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
This action I take to improve my learning process.

**Set Goals:** Decide what I want to learn.

**Be Active:** Take notes and ask questions.

**Review Regularly:** Review self to reduce mistakes.

**Understand Concepts:** Focus on understanding, not just memorizing.

**Teach Others:** Explain what you've learned to someone else.

**Take Breaks:** Rest between study sessions.

**Reflect:** Think about how you can use what you've learned.

**Stay Organized:** Keep your materials and goals organized.

**Get Feedback:** Ask for advice to improve your learning approach.
