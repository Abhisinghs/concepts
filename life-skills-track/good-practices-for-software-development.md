# Good Practices for Software Development
## Q1) Which point(s) were new to you?
These are new things for me -
* **Consolidating Questions in One Message:**

  This point about being mindful of teammates’ time and sending all questions in a single message to avoid overwhelming them is a great practice that’s not always highlighted.

* **Video Call Etiquette:**
 
  The emphasis on keeping your video on during meetings to build rapport is a useful reminder of how non-verbal communication can enhance team dynamics.

* **Tracking Time with Apps:**

  While the idea of tracking time is not new, suggesting specific tools like Boosted or discussing the impact on productivity adds a practical element that can help in managing work effectively.

* **Deep Work Concept:**

  Although the idea of deep work is recognized, the link to programming as a sustained attention activity might encourage developers to actively seek ways to improve their focus.

* **Proactive Engagement in Meetings:**

  The suggestion to join meetings early for informal interaction can strengthen team relationships, which is sometimes overlooked in remote settings.

  ## Q2) Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

* **Prepare Questions:** Before reaching out, gather all your questions or concerns and write them down to ensure clarity.

* **Use a Standard Format:** Create a template for asking questions that includes context, the specific issue, and any solutions you’ve tried.

* **Leverage Group Check-Ins:** Schedule regular team meetings to discuss questions and concerns collectively, reducing the need for individual messages.

* **Seek Feedback:** After discussions, ask your teammates for feedback on your communication style to identify areas for improvement.
